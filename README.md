# Multi-Object-UV-Editing
This Blender Addon enables a quick way to create one UV Layout for multiple objects.

# Usage:
Just select multiple mesh objects and then press the "Multi Object UV Editing" Button in the Object Tools Panel.
This will bring you into editmode of all selected mesh objects and lets you create one UV Layout for all objects. If no
UV Map is existent, just create one. Start editing your UV's.
Once you are done, just press tab to leave the edit mode and get back to object mode. Thats it. All your selected objects
are updated with new UV's.
