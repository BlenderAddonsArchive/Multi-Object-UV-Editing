# Multi-Object-UV-Editing
This Blender Addon enables a quick way to create one UV Layout for multiple objects.

# Installation
- If you download the zip from this repository, make sure you extract the zipfile before you try to install it via blenders addon manager. Github packages every files in a subfolder, which results in a not functioning addon installation. So install the multi_object_uv_edit.py directly.

# Usage
- Just select multiple mesh objects and then press the "Multi Object UV Editing" Button in the Object Tools Panel.
This will bring you into editmode of all selected mesh objects and lets you create one UV Layout for all objects. If no
UV Map is existent, just create one.
- Start editing your UV's.
- Once you are done, just press tab to leave the edit mode and get back to object mode. Thats it. All your selected objects are updated with new UV's.

Here is a video presentation of how the addon works:
